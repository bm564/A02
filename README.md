- **Branch**: A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository,
but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. 

- **Clone**:A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere,
or the act of making that copy.

- **Commit**: A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files).
Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.

- **Fetch**: When you use git fetch, you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them. 
Unlike git pull, fetching allows you to review changes before committing them to your local branch.

- **GIT**: Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files.

- **Github**: GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories.

- **Merge**:Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.
This often happens as a "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. 

- **Merge Conflict**:A difference that occurs between merged branches. 
Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.

- **Push**: To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. 
For instance, if you change something locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them.

- **Pull**:Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. 
For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.

- **Remote**: This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. 
Remote versions can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.

- **Repository**: A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. 
Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
